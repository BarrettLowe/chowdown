yield: ~ biscuits

ingredients:
  - 3 oz butter
  - 3.5 oz golden castor sugar
  - 1 small egg
  - 1 tsp vanilla essence
  - 1.5 oz raisins
  - 1.5 oz dried cranberries
  - 2 oz sunflower seeds
  - 2 oz beremeal
  - 0.5 tsp bicarbonate of soda
  - 0.5 tsp salt
  - 1.5 oz porridge oats


directions:
  - Cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy
  - Beat in the egg and vanilla essence
  - Stir in the remaining ingredients until combined
  - Roll into balls and place on a baking sheet. This mix should come away clean from your hands otherwise the biscuits will spread too much in the oven. Add a little more beremeal to stop this happening.
  - Bake in the top of the oven for 12-14 minutes at 180Â°C until golden.
  - Cool flat on a rack and store in an airtight container.

These biscuits carry the unique flavour of the beremeal grain which these days is only grown in the Orkney Islands.
