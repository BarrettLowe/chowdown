ingredients:
  - 350g Quorn Mince
  - 1 tbsp olive oil (Quorn just needs to be added to the sauce, so the recipe requires about 50% less oil than you would usually use)
  - 1 medium onion, finely chopped
  - 1 medium carrot, finely chopped
  - 100g frozen peas or mixed veg
  - 400ml vegetable stock
  - 1 dessert spoon vegetarian Worcestershire Sauce (optional)
  - 1 tbsp tomato puree
  - 2 tbsp salt reduced soy sauce
  - 1 tbsp cornflour, mixed to a paste in 1 tbsp cold water
  - 700g potatoes, peeled and roughly chopped
  - 225g parsnips, peeled and chopped
  - 2 tbsp semi-skimmed milk
  - salt and freshly ground pepper

directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 180Â°C
  - Boil the potatoes and parsnip until tender. Drain and set aside.
  - Meanwhile heat the oil in a saucepan, add the onion and the carrot and fry gently until softened.
  - Add the Quorn Mince, frozen veg, vegetable stock, vegetarian Worcestershire sauce, tomato puree, soy sauce and seasoning. Simmer for 5 minutes and then add the cornflour made into a paste with the tablespoon of cold water and continue to simmer gently, stirring all the time, until thickened. Place in an ovenproof dish.
  - Mash the potatoes and parsnip with the milk until smooth, season to taste with the salt and pepper. Place the topping over the Quorn mince filling and fluff up with a fork.
  - Bake for 20 minutes until the topping is crisp.
  - Serve with a selection of fresh vegetables.
