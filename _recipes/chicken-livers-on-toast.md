components:
  - Easy Sourdough Loaves

ingredients:
  - 250g chicken livers
  - 2 shallots, finely chopped
  - large handful flatleaf parsley, leaves very roughly chopped
  - 1 tbsp capers, rinsed and drained, roughly chopped
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - 3 tbsp sherry vinegar
  - 4 slices nice bread, such as sourdough
  - 1 tbsp plain flour
  - large pinch cayenne pepper

directions:
  - Pick over the livers, cutting away any fatty bits and sinew, then pat the livers dry. Place the shallot, parsley and capers into a bowl and drizzle with half the olive oil and 1 tbsp of the Sherry vinegar.
  - Toast the bread (preferably on a griddle but a toaster is fine). Toss the livers in the flour and cayenne pepper, and season generously with salt and pepper. Heat the rest of the oil in a frying pan and fry the livers over a really high heat for 4-5 mins until brown and crisp on the outside and cooked, but still a little pink in the middle. Splash remaining vinegar into the pan and bubble down for 1 min.
  - Tip the contents of the pan in with the shallot and parsley, toss everything together, season to taste, then pile onto the toasted bread. Season with a little crunchy sea salt and serve.
