ingredients:
- 350g/12oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 2 tsp mixed spice
- 250g/9oz golden caster sugar
- 1 orange, zest only
- 85g/3oz raisins or currants
- 85g/3oz goji berries or dried cranberries
- 50g/1¾oz cashews or macadamias, roughly chopped
- 50g/1¾oz pecans or pistachios, roughly chopped
- 3 large free-range eggs, beaten

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 160°C Fan. Line 2 baking trays with greaseproof paper or silicone mats.
- Put the flour, baking powder, mixed spice and sugar in a bowl and mix. Now add the orange zest, currants, cranberries, macadamias and pistachios and give it a quick mix. Add the beaten egg and bring the dough together by hand.
- Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and divide into 4 pieces. Roll out to about 30cm/12in long and place 2 on each tray (make sure they are spaced apart).
- Bake for 25-30 minutes until the dough has risen and is firm, but it should still look very pale.
- Remove from the oven and leave it on the tray. Reduce the oven temperature to 120°C Fan.
- Using a bread knife cut 1cm/½in-wide slices diagonally into the dough. Put the slices on a large baking tray and bake for a further 15 minutes until dry and golden-brown. Leave to cool on a wire rack.
