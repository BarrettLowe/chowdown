ingredients:
  - 1 cup whole-wheat flour
  - 1 cup white flour
  - 2 tsp yeast
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - ½ teaspoon sugar
  - ¾ cup hot water

directions:
  - Combine flours, yeast, salt and sugar in a food processor. Add hot water and oil until the mixture forms a sticky ball. The dough should be quite soft. If it seems dry, add 1 to 2 tablespoons warm water; if too sticky, add 1 to 2 tablespoons flour. Process until the dough forms a ball, then process for 1 minute to knead.
  - Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Cover and let the dough rest for 10 to 20 minutes before rolling.
  - Place a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the lowest oven rack; preheat oven 220°C. Roll and top the pizza as desired (13-inch circle) and bake the pizza until the bottom is crisp and golden, 10 to 14 minutes. Serve immediately.
