ingredients:
  - 1kg mixed dried fruit (use a mix of raisins, sultanas, currants, cherries, cranberries, prunes or figs)
  - zest and juice 1 orange
  - zest and juice 1 lemon
  - 150ml brandy, Sherry, whisky or rum, plus extra for feeding
  - 250g pack butter, softened
  - 200g light soft brown sugar
  - 175g plain flour
  - 100g ground almond
  - ½ tsp baking powder
  - 2 tsp mixed spice
  - 1 tsp ground cinnamon
  - ¼ tsp ground cloves
  - 100g flaked almond
  - 4 large eggs
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract

directions:
  - Put 1kg mixed dried fruit, the zest and juice of 1 orange and 1 lemon, 150ml brandy or other alcohol, 250g softened butter and 200g light, soft brown sugar in a large pan set over a medium heat.
  - Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 5 mins. Tip the fruit mixture into a large bowl and leave to cool for 30 mins.
  - Heat oven to 150C/130C fan/gas 2. Line a deep 20cm cake tin with a double layer of baking parchment, then wrap a double layer of newspaper around the outside – tie with string to secure.
  - Add 175g plain flour, 100g ground almonds, ½ tsp baking powder, 2 tsp mixed spice, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, ¼ tsp ground cloves, 100g flaked almonds, 4 large eggs and 1 tsp vanilla extract to the fruit mixture and stir well, making sure there are no pockets of flour.
  - Tip into your prepared tin, level the top with a spatula and bake in the centre of the oven for 2 hrs.
  - Remove the cake from the oven, poke holes in it with a skewer and spoon over 2 tbsp of your chosen alcohol. Leave the cake to cool completely in the tin.
  - To store, peel off the baking parchment, then wrap well in cling film. Feed the cake with 1-2 tbsp alcohol every fortnight, until you ice it.
  - Don’t feed the cake for the final week to give the surface a chance to dry before icing.
